# ukpersonalfinance

This project eventually aims to be a complete personal finance package for the UK tax system.

Currently this package purely contains calculations for the following contributions which appear on UK payslips:
1. Income Tax
2. National Insurance
3. Student Loans
4. Autoenrolement Pension

There are also static methods for calculating:
1. Simple Interest Rate
2. Compound Intrest Rate

I am not responsible for any financial decisions made as a result of this code. This project is in an alpha state, expect bugs and use with caution.

Install using:
` pip install ukpersonalfinance`
